                As part of Team Qatar for the FIRST Global Challenge, I serve as the Engineering Notebook Lead,

                with teammates on mechanical design, coding, and systems integration while ensuring our work meets
                international standards. Participating on this level has taught me adaptability, project management, and
                how to communicate complex engineering ideas clearly.
                <br> I also actively contribute to my school’s robotics and engineering clubs, where I focus on coding
                our robot, while aiding in building. I’ve competed in the national FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), gaining
                experience in problem-solving under pressure and teamwork in high-stakes environments, and being one of
                the members of a new team that recieved the Finalist Award by placing as the second alliance.

                I’m a club leader in Challengers, a program that pairs volunteers with children and young adults with
                special needs to play baseball in an inclusive, supportive environment. In this role, I help organize
                games, guide volunteers, and support athletes directly on the field. For my contributions, I was honored
                with a Service Award, recognizing my commitment to fostering inclusion and community through sports.
                <br>
                Beyond Challengers, I’m also developing an autism support app, designed to provide families and
                individuals with better tools for communication and daily life. Both of these experiences fuel my
                passion for combining leadership, empathy, and technology to create meaningful impact.
